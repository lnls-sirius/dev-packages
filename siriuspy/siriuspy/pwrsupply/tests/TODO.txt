pending:

2019-10-18 - [firmware]: do not ignore requests for OpMode changes if wfmref index is not parked. Process these requests at the end of ramp cycles.
2019-10-18 - [firmware]: when a setpoint is received while in SlowRefSync, update PS_SETPOINT variable so that the IOC knows that the UDC received its request.
2019-10-23 - [firmware]: disabling BUFSAMPLE from one ps applies to all in the same UDC?
2019-10-23 - [firmware]: create new BSMP variable that mirrors last setpoint received by ARM
2019-10-23 - [firmware]: change SYNC_PULSE and RESET_UDC bsmp functions so that they always return OK.

2019-10-18 - [etherbridge]: write new optimized version.

2019-10-18 - [psioc]: debug anomalous responses
2019-10-18 - [psioc]: benchmark all BSMP commands for all power supply models
2019-10-18 - [psioc]: implement BSMP read/write classes for BSMP parameters.


solved:

2019-10-21 - [firmware]: discard FBP mirror bsmp variables
             these variables will continue to exist for debugging purposes. the IOC will not use them.
